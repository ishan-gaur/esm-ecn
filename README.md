TODO: 
1. move as much of this into a setup script as possible
2. start your own caching library based on sebastian prillo's
3. include that in the install by default, in addition to polars, seaborn, etc.

The ```db``` folder is intended to be a centralized deposition location for the core results generated by a project, in order to make it easy to access them during prototyping or plotting key figures.

The ```data``` folder is for external data sources.

The ```notebooks``` folder is for IPython Notebooks.

Because these are housed in a separate folder, this repo comes with the scaffolding needed to package your ```src``` easily, so you can import common code seamlessly without cluttering the home directory.

Put all code in ```src``` from the beginning :)


If on local and using pyenv, create a new environment with:
1. pyenv virtualenv <python-version> <env-name>
2. cd to project
3. pyenv local <env-name> # to make it activate by default in the project folder

Or for conda/mamba:
1. mamba create --name DEFAULT_ENV_NAME python=3.10

Prepare the repo for building the package
1. Edit the package directory name under the src folder
2. Change all the fields with DEFAULT_* in the pyproject.toml
3. Remember that package names can't have hyphens. This applies to the name in the toml and in the src folder.

Make sure to check email to be the one you want correspondance to for this package
1. python3 -m pip install --upgrade build
2. python3 -m build
3. check whl is in the ./dist/ directory
4. pip install -e .
